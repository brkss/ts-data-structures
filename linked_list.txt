-> Linked List 

-linear data structure 
-elements are not stored in contunious memory locations
-the elements are linked using pointers 
-cant index elements we must travers the list when we need to access to a specific element 

-> Time Complexity 
- insertion : 
	head -> O(1)
	middle -> O(n) => pushing other elements
	tail  -> O(1)
-Access : O(n)
-Update : O(n)
-Search : O(n)
